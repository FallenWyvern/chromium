Regression test for <webview> dialog.
In current stable/beta, brining up window.confirm dialog hangs guest.
r228920 fixes this.

Click inside the guest "click to open dialog", if you can click and keep
selecting and changing selection of this text, then the bug is fixed.

If the regression is present, you'd see the guest go stale, getting into
a state where you cannot select/change selection of the text.
