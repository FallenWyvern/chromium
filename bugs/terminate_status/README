Test app for checking browser plugin renderer NOTREACHED/crash BrowserPlugin::OnGuestGone() {gets termination status = TERMINATION_STATUS_STILL_RUNNING}

Reproduce steps: (hard to reproduce)
I've only found this is OSX, haven't tried to repro it on other platforms.

1. Open this app, this has lots of guests.
2. Click on "Terminate" button and immediately close the app using Command+w.
3. Repeat 1-2 until you see the app crash as NOTREACHED is reached (pun) in BrowserPlugin::OnGuestGone.
